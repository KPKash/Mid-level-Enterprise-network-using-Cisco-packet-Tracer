# Mid-level-Enterprise-network-using-Cisco-packet-Tracer

The foundation of any successful enterprise network lies in its ability to seamlessly connect and facilitate communication between diverse systems, applications, and users. Cisco Packet Tracer, with its user-friendly interface and extensive feature set, provides an ideal platform for simulating real-world networking scenarios. This project aims to demonstrate the practical application of network design principles, Cisco technologies, and best practices in crafting an enterprise network that aligns with the evolving needs of modern organizations. 

Enterprise Network is most needed in recent times as many corporates opened branches across various places. The administrative process and the main server are split into various branches to access the network under the same network. In this management, the computers can connect both via intra and inter connectivity with other computers under the same organization main server, so enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer emphasizes that the network connectivity through servers and routers and switches and other computers in the same location and in different locations. 

The main objective of the proposed network is  
  To update the existing network  
  To enhance its capabilities  
  To increase the flexibility of the network.  
Cisco Packet Tracer offers an effective, interactive environment for learning networking concepts and protocols. Most importantly, Packet Tracer helps students and instructors create their own virtual “network worlds” for exploration, experimentation, and explanation of networking concepts and technologies.  

#COMPONENTS USED: 
1)Switch  
  A network switch is a crucial component in computer networking, playing a pivotal role in connecting devices within a local area network (LAN). Switches use packet switching to forward 	data. Each incoming data packet is   
  examined, and the switch determines the optimal path to 	send it to the intended device. This process enhances efficiency by reducing unnecessary data transmission. 
2)Router 
  Primary function of router is to determine the optimal path for data packets to travel from the 	source to the destination across interconnected networks. Routers use routing tables and algorithms to make decisions     
  about the best path for data packets to reach their destination. They consider factors such as network topology, traffic load, and cost to determine the most 		efficient route. 
3)Server 
  A server is a foundational networking device designed to provide services, resources, or data to 	other devices on a network. It plays a central role in network architecture, facilitating communication, storage, and   
  collaboration. 
4)End user Devices 
  PC’s and mobile phones serve as the primary devices for end-users to connect, communicate, 	and access resources within a networked environment. 
5)Connectivity Lines  
  Connectivity lines, often referred to as communication lines or network connections, are the 	physical or virtual pathways that enable the transfer of data between devices in a network. 	These lines play a crucial role in   establishing communication and facilitating the exchange of information
